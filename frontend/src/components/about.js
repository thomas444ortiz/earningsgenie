                <h2>What is EarningsGenie?</h2>
                <body>EarningsGenie allows you to find public company earnings call transcripts, and use AI to chat with them (similar to BAMSec, Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool, 
                        but with better AI features). Because you can upload any PDF file and chat with it, 
                        it isn't limited to earnings calls, but that is our focus at the moment.</body>

                <h2>The Backstory</h2>
                <body>In my recent past as an investment banker, I would occassionally be listening in on earnings calls and providing summaries over email to my bosses. 
                        I also would frequently be looking through long documents for answers on very niche topics. This automates both, and I get good feedback
                        I will work to improve the features and get more documents in.</body>
